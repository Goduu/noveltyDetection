## Introduction

Data are a very valuable resources today and is being generated by
different devices all the time. The relevance of being able to use it in a way
that can have important insights for the business becomes even greater
when it comes to detecting non-technical losses in the energy distribution
grid, which has a direct impact on the company's revenue. This work aims to
present the application of the concept of data stream used to iteratively train
a Hoeffding Tree model in order to be able to predict the consumption. Then
with the predicted value detect novelties and make a qualitative analysis of
how novelty detection can assist in the identification of non-technical losses. 

## Overview
This code is the base of a final paper which aims to detect novelty in energy consumption data using a iterative approach with Scikit Multiflow's Hoeffding Tree.
